      "bio": "I was born and raised in Queens, NY to an Argentinean mother and a Puerto Rican father. Sadly, as luck would have it, I play soccer like a Puerto Rican and baseball like an Argentine. ‚öΩ‚öæ Since it was obvious from an early age that I was not destined to be a sports pro, I dedicated myself to collecting degrees: B.S. - Mechanical Engineering (Columbia University), M.S. - Mechanical Engineering (The Georgia Institute of Technology), MBA (The Massachusetts Institute of Technology Sloan School of Management). üë®‚Äçüéì Unfortunately, collecting degrees turned into quite an expensive hobby, so in 2011 I joined HubSpot and tried my hand at sales, and that is when things got interesting! From November 2011 through January 2023 I spearheaded HubSpot's expansion into Latin America and Brazil, my primary focus being to develop HubSpot's go-to-market strategy in these markets. üöÄ Helping HubSpot expand across Latin America opened many doors for me, and allowed me to share my experience scaling a B2B sales organization as a mentor, angel investor, and LP in various funds. üë®‚Äçüè´ Currently, I am evaluating the next adventure to undertake, while enjoying more time with my family. üë™"
